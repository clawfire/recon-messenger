# 💬 Recon Messenger

This application is a simple Electron wrapper around http://messenger.recon.com. I made it few weeks / months ago. I hope the folks at [Recon](http://recon.com) didn't mind if I share it with you since ... you know ... It's not a big deal and some of you may prefer having a little companion app rather a window browser.
